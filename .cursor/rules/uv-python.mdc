# Use uv for Python

This project uses `uv` for Python package management. **Always use `uv run` to execute Python code.**

## Running Python

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT
uv run python script.py
uv run pytest tests/
uv run python -m module

# ❌ WRONG - these will fail or use wrong environment
python script.py
python3 script.py
pytest tests/
pip install package
```

## Installing Dependencies

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT
uv add package-name
uv sync

# ❌ WRONG
pip install package-name
```

## Why

- Project dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml` and locked in `uv.lock`
- `uv run` ensures the correct virtual environment and dependencies are used
- Direct `python` or `pip` commands will use system Python or wrong environment
