## Schematic

Open `actuator-board.kicad_sch` in KiCad 9 for the full schematic with design notes.

Unfortunately Cursor failed to create a viable schematic, loads of halucinations, pins that didnt exist, and although KiCad files are text, all it did was copy
text into the file which displayed as text. Models tried Gemini 3 adn Claud Opus 4.5. Neither produced a viable design.
